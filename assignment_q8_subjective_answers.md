![Time Complexity](q8.png)<br />
Conclusion:<br />
The theoretical time complexities for normal method is O(n*(d^2)+d^3) and for gradient descent is O(ndt) <br />
When N (no. of samples) varies, both plots should be linear. This is true for our case as well. <br />
When d(no. of features) varies, normal method should growing cubic in d, while gradient descent should grow linearly. The plot mathes the theory for gradient descent. <br />
